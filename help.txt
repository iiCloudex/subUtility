USAGE:

sub [ -h | -fromChars +toChars [-i inputFile] [-o outputFile] ]

DESCRIPTION:

This utility copies text from an input stream to an output stream replacing every 
instance of a specific character in fromChars with a corresponding (position-wise) 
character from toChars. Any characters in fromChars and in toChars that do not 
have corresponding counterparts in the other one are ignored. If an input file is 
provided, the content is read from that file; otherwise, the standard input is used. 
If an output file is provided, then the modified content is written to that file; 
otherwise, the standard output is used.
